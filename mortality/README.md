## Mortality plots

Making these mortaility plots made me cry. I know that people die all the time. Even without a pandemic, on the order of 8 million people a month pass away. COVID-19 deaths are at an early enough point in their exponential growth that they are very small compared to that. But I had never before been personally involved in counting deaths. It is very grim.
