# COVID-19-plots

These plots are thanks to the open availability of the [database](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) for the [Johns Hopkins COVID-19 dashboard](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).

### Daily percentile growth rates in confirmed cases per country

The first plot shows the percentage daily growth in number of confirmed cases for a selected set of countries. For each country, the data plot starts after 50 cases were reached (it is too noise before that). 

Notable trends include South Korea's gradual slowing of it's growth rate, and the fact that although Japan's growth rate has been much smaller than most other countries, it has held steady. Caseloads growing at a contsant exponential rate  correspond to a horizontal line in this plot. In other words, although growth rate in Japan is comparatively slower than others, it is still exponential growth.
